    <h3>Steps To Make Fish Fried</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Pat the fish fillets dry with a paper towel.</li>
      <li>In a big bowl, mix together all the batter ingredients with a whisk. Make a smooth, thick batter with water.</li>
      <li>To the bowl add the fish and coat it well with the batter. Keep aside for 15 minutes. Don't leave the fish for too long or it will get way too soft.</li>
      <li>Heat oil for deep frying in a big pot. On medium heat, drop the fish fingers in batches. Don't overcrowd. Flip over so that they are equally golden on both sides. When they are half-way cooked and the coating has stuck to the fish, remove to a paper towel.</li>
      <li>Let cool for 15-20 mins while you fry the remaining batch.</li>
      <li>Then re-fry the fish fillets for extra crispiness till they are cooked through and are golden brown.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle chaat masala as soon as they are out and enjoy them with your favourite chutney.</li>
    </ol>
